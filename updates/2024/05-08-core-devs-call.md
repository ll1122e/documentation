# Client Team Updates
## EL

* **Nethermind**: 
    * Snap sync and half-path published last week
    * Preparing for Pectra


* **Erigon**: 
  * Switched internal development to Erigon 3
  * Release candidate of Erigon v2.60.0
    * Should be the last significant v2 release
    * There might still be patch releases
    * Includes the `eth_getLogs` regression introduced in v2.59
      * Log pruning issue fix described in the release notes: 
          * https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/releases/tag/v2.60.0-rc1
                * Required for people who ran v2.59 with pruning
  * Erigon v3
    * Syncs way faster (doesnâ€™t have to execute all blocks since genesis)
    * Granularity of state history is much finer
    * Should be cheaper to run because less data has to be on fast drives and colder history can be on cheaper disks

  * No update


# Chain Infra

* **Gateway**
  * No update


# Innovation

* Shutter
    * Nethermind now integrates with the keypers, nothing is hardcoded anymore
